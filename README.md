# Dribdat

**Tooling for time-limited, team-based, FAIR and open-by-default cooperation** that bundles together guidelines, timers, trackers, loggers, integrates with prototyping tools, group chat, code repositories, open data APIs, and more!

`Dribdat` is an open source web application that playfully assists teams collaborating on technical projects with data.
Designed to support your [awesome hackathon](https://github.com/dribdat/awesome-hackathon), it is used as a versatile toolbox for civic tech sprints:
see [Tour de Hack](https://dribdat.cc/tour) for some examples, and [User handbook](https://dribdat.cc/usage) for screenshots.

# Purpose

The philosophy of this project, in a nutshell, is:

- **live and let live** (no tech religion, use whatever design / dev / doc tools you want as long as they are accessible to your team)
- **commit sustainably** (aggregate outputs in standard web of data formats for optimal search and archiving)
- **create in safe spaces** (embedded code of conduct, works offline, minimal privacy footprint).

[Install](https://dribdat.cc/deploy) the software, read our [Whitepaper](https://dribdat.cc/whitepaper), or try dribdat yourself at a [community](https://forum.opendata.ch/c/expeditions/hackathons/16/l/latest) hackathon.

For more background and references, see the [User Handbook](https://docs.dribdat.cc/usage). If you need help or advice in setting up your event, or would like to contribute to the project: please get in touch via [Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/dribdat/discussions) or [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/dribdat/dribdat/issues).

# Quickstart

The Dribdat project can be deployed to any server capable of serving [Python](https://python.org) applications, and is set up for fast deployment using [Ansible or Docker](https://dribdat.cc/deploy). The first user that registers becomes an admin, so don't delay!

If you would like to run dribdat on any other cloud or local machine, there are additional instructions in the [Deployment guide](https://docs.dribdat.cc/deploy). Information on contributing and extending the code can be found in the [Contributors guide](https://docs.dribdat.cc/contribute), which includes API documentation, and other details.

See also **[backboard](https://github.com/dribdat/backboard)**: a responsive, modern alternative frontend, and our **[dridbot](https://github.com/dribdat/dridbot)** chat client. Both demonstrate reuse of the dribdat API.

If you need support with your deployment, please reach out through [Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/dribdat/discussions).

# Credits

This application was based on [cookiecutter-flask](https://github.com/sloria/cookiecutter-flask) by [Steven Loria](https://github.com/sloria), a more modern version of which is [cookiecutter-flask-restful](https://github.com/karec/cookiecutter-flask-restful) - and could be a good basis for your own hackathon projects.

This project is currently mantained by [@loleg](https://github.com/loleg). See [Contributors](https://github.com/dataletsch/dribdat/graphs/contributors) and [Forks](https://github.com/dataletsch/dribdat/network/members) to find other users of this project.

Special thanks to the [Open Data](https://hack.opendata.ch), [Open Networking](https://now.makezurich.ch/) and [Open Source](https://hacknight.dinacon.ch) communities in ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­ Switzerland for the many trials and feedbacks through over one hundred events. Connect with us for your next [Data Expedition](https://schoolofdata.ch)!

This project is inspired by the work of hackathonistas to the [East](https://meta.dribdat.cc/project/42), [West](https://meta.dribdat.cc/project/7), [North](https://meta.dribdat.cc/project/10), and [South](https://meta.dribdat.cc/project/41).
