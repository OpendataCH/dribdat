## Challenges

The starting point of [awesome hackathons](https://github.com/dribdat/awesome-hackathon?tab=readme-ov-file#awesome-hackathon):
a short description of a problem, some initial ideas of solutions which can be realistically attempted during the time constraints of the event. Once you create your event page, you can attach challenges that the teams should respond to.

<label><input type="checkbox"> 1. Create a series of **Challenges** (optionally organized in **Categories**)</label><br>
<label><input type="checkbox"> 2. Use the **Quickstart** section to share tips with challenge owners</label><br>
<label><input type="checkbox"> 3. Create a **Template** event to make things easier here</label><br>

## Team-building

Some people like to hack on their own - for others, hackathons are all about collaboration and meeting new people. A team generally consists of 3 to 8 people. You can encourage your participants to set up a profile with roles that you can define in the _Presets_ menu to create a smooth team-building process.

<label><input type="checkbox"> 4. Decide what **Roles** are appropriate to your event </label><br>
<label><input type="checkbox"> 5. Encourage participants to create an online **Profile** here </label><br>
<label><input type="checkbox"> 6. Facilitate team-building by having everyone try to **Join** a challenge </label><br>

## Resources

When participants bring their own material (e.g. software or hardware), sharing is encouraged as long as the entire team can use them easily and legally. This is why we encourage the use of free, open source/open data, web-accessible. Try to help participants from a wide range experience levels to get started.

<label><input type="checkbox"> 7. Provide links in your event **Instructions**, such as to collections of open datasets </label><br>
<label><input type="checkbox"> 8. Set up a **Resources** area with tools and datasets recommended for each stage </label><br>
<label><input type="checkbox"> 9. Customize the event **Stages** with your own hints and progression rules </label><br>

## Conduct

In the interest of creating a safe and inclusive environment, we strongly encourage applying clear terms and licenses to your event. We have provided an example at the bottom of every page, which you may modify, and also include a reference to in your opening presentation or e-mailed instructions.

<label><input type="checkbox"> A. Check the **Community** section in your event settings, by default this is the [Hack Code of Conduct](https://hackcodeofconduct.org/) + [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) </label><br>
<label><input type="checkbox"> B. Make sure that your organising team is ready to enforce the Code of Conduct, discuss your conditions with participants </label><br>
<label><input type="checkbox"> C. Verify compliance during evaluation rounds, when issuing certificates, or other post-event analysis </label><br>
